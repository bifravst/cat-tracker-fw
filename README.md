**Note:** :truck: superseeded by [firmware](https://github.com/bifravst/firmware).

We no longer maintain a fork of [fw-nrfconnect-nrf](https://github.com/NordicPlayground/fw-nrfconnect-nrf) but are using a new feature of west which allows to use it as a dependency, so our source code tree in [firmware](https://github.com/bifravst/firmware) only contains the application itself.
